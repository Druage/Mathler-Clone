## Game Rules

Initially I was not familiar with the rules of Mathler but I have obtained a full list from https://www.tomsguide.com/news/what-is-mathler-and-how-to-play, which are pasted below.

1. You have to guess the solution in six goes or less
2. Every equation you enter must be a valid answer. So if the answer is 20, your guess can't be 50+5-2 because that doesn't equal 20. Right away, this is one of the toughest things about it.
3. The equations follow the PEDMAS rule, which means you do them in the order of parentheses, exponentials, division, multiplication, addition and then subtraction.
4. A correct entry turns green
5. A correct entry in the wrong place turns yellow
6. An incorrect entry turns gray / red
7. Digits and operations can be used more than once

## Installation
